# FAQ
### Is this open source?
- Yes and no...? Most of my image assets are still living within the project itself as I haven't had the time to properly host them on an external server. Feel free to clone the project for your own perusal, be warned that it might be fairly large due to the images. The code's fairly messy right now and I plan to clean it up in the near future, but for now it will probably stay as such. 

### Did you use any external CSS libraries to create the UI?
- Nope! Most of the code you see was manually crafted out by me, I took reference from a Windows 95 emulator slowly pieced together the UI with pure CSS

### Can I contact you?
- Of course! [Email me](mailto:muhammad-zulfikar@duck.com)
